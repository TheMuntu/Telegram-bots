# qr code scanner

This is a Telegram bot that allows users to scan QR codes and get instant information about the code's content in telegram.

This bot has two handlers: 
- one for the `/scan` command, which prompts the user to send a QR code.
- another for QR code messages, which decodes the QR code and sends the content back to the user.

To use this bot, you will need to install the `pyqrcode` library, which you can do by running `pip install pyqrcode`. 
You will also need to replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with your own Telegram bot token.
